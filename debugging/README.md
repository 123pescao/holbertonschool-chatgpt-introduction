ChatGPT - Introduction

Welcome to the "ChatGPT - Introduction" project, where you'll learn how to use AI to improve your coding skills! This project is part of our IT curriculum and focuses on enhancing code quality and efficiency by integrating artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, into your everyday coding practices.
Project Overview

This project covers two important aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By completing the tasks in this project, you will learn how to:

    Debug Code Efficiently: Use ChatGPT to find and fix coding errors across different programming languages. This will help you become better at troubleshooting and understanding common programming mistakes.
    Automate Repetitive Tasks: Use ChatGPT to automate tasks like generating basic code, documentation, and unit tests. This will allow you to focus more on the creative and challenging parts of software development.

Learning Objectives

    Debugging Skills: Understand how AI can help identify and solve coding errors. Practice using ChatGPT to diagnose and fix bugs in code samples provided in different programming languages.
    Automation Skills: Learn how to use AI to automate routine coding tasks. This will help you write cleaner, more organized code while saving time and reducing errors.

Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have:

    Improved Debugging Skills: You will be able to effectively identify and fix coding errors and explain problems clearly.
    Proficiency in Automation: You will know how to use AI tools to automate various coding tasks, leading to more efficient and error-free code.

Project Tasks

    Debugging - Python Factorial: Fix a Python script to correctly compute the factorial of a number.
    Debugging - Python Arguments: Modify a Python script to only print command-line arguments, excluding the script name.
    Debugging - HTML/JavaScript: Correct an HTML/JavaScript file to change the background color when a button is clicked.
    Debugging - Python Minesweeper: Improve a Minesweeper game script by adding a feature to detect when all non-mine cells are revealed.
    Documentation - Python Factorial: Add detailed comments to a Python script that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
    Error Handling - Python Checkbook: Add error handling to a Python script that simulates a checkbook, preventing crashes due to invalid input.
    Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python: Correct and test a Python script for a Tic Tac Toe game to ensure all user inputs work properly.
